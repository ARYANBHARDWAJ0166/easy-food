        <h1>About Easy Food</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Easy Food! We understand that cooking while living away from home can be challenging, especially for students. That's why we provide a collection of easy, quick, and budget-friendly recipes tailored for students who want to enjoy delicious meals without spending too much time or money.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to empower students by providing them with the knowledge and skills to prepare healthy, homemade meals. We believe that cooking should be fun and accessible to everyone, regardless of their culinary experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Future Goals</h2>
        <p>At Easy Food, our mission is to make the lives of students and young professionals easier by providing quick, easy-to-make recipes. As we grow, we’re committed to expanding our services to create an all-in-one platform that goes beyond recipes:

          Grocery Shop: We understand that gathering ingredients can be time-consuming and costly. To simplify this, we plan to integrate a grocery shopping feature, enabling users to purchase fresh, affordable ingredients directly through our platform, tailored to the recipes they choose.
          
          Dedicated Maid Booking Platform: We’re also working to launch a separate website for maid booking, extending our support for those who need reliable home assistance. This platform will connect users with skilled, trained maids from diverse backgrounds, making it easy to book trusted help right from home.
          
          Expanded Recipe Collection and Cooking Tools: As our community grows, we aim to add more recipes and cooking tools that cater to all dietary needs, from vegan to gluten-free options, and provide expert tips on healthy eating.
          
          Through these steps, we’re building a resource that supports both daily life and personal well-being, making Easy Food a comprehensive support system for our users.
